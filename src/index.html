      <!-- Button-related tests. -->
      <div>
        <!--
          1. Default MyButton component tag.

          Example does not include slot content or supplementary attributes.
        -->
        <my-button></my-button>

        <!--
          2. MyButton component with supplementary class.

          Example includes a `class` attribute with a value of 'themed'.
          Since the component styles include a `:host()` pseudo-selector,
          the presence of the 'themed' class name results in the application
          of additional styles.
        -->
        <my-button class="themed"></my-button>

        <!--
          3. MyButton component with 'styles' slot content.

          Example makes use of the 'styles' slot to inject a <style> tag
          directly into the MyButton component. Since the MyButton
          component's text content is encapsulated, it is unaffected by
          the <style> tag.

          However, since the <style> tag is defined outside of the component,
          other instances of the <button> tag are affected.
        -->
        <my-button>
          <style slot="styles">
button {
  color: gold;
}
          </style>
        </my-button>

        <!--
          4. MyButton component with 'content' slot content.

          Example makes use of the 'content' slot to inject an <input />
          element directly into the MyButton component. Due to the
          structure of the MyButton component, both the <button> tag
          and its text content are replaced.
        -->
        <my-button>
          <div slot="content">
            <input type="button" value="This is an input-type button" />
          </div>
        </my-button>

        <!--
          5. MyButton component with 'inner' slot content.

          Examples makes use of the 'inner' slot to inject custom text
          content directly into the MyButton component. Due to the
          structure of the MyButton component, the <button> tag is
          preserved and the default text is replaced.
        -->
        <my-button>
          <span slot="inner">This is some custom text content</span>
        </my-button>

        <!-- 'Vanilla' HTML button elements. -->
        <button>This is a 'Vanilla' HTML button</button>
        <input type="button" value="This is a 'Vanilla' HTML input-type button" />
      </div>
